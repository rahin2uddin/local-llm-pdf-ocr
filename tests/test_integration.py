Integration tests: real Surya detection + real PDF I/O + stubbed LLM.

These validate that the full pipeline executes end-to-end against the on-disk

    Regression for the bug where examples/hybrid.pdf produced an output
    PDF with two consecutive identical lines ("Name: Sally Walker DOB: ..."
    appeared twice; "HEALTH INTAKE FORM" appeared twice in another run).

    Root cause was a DP misalignment: the symmetric ``_match_cost`` let
    a long line slide into a smaller box just because the char counts
    happened to align, leaving the visually-correct wide box empty. The
    refine stage then cropped the empty box and re-OCR'd the same
    handwritten line, producing a second copy in the output text layer.

    The fix combines two changes:
      1. ``_match_cost`` is now asymmetric — overfill (line longer than
         box capacity) costs more than equivalent underfill, so the DP
         skips a too-narrow box rather than packing a long line into it.
      2. After refine, ``_drop_refined_duplicates`` clears any refined
         box whose text is a substring of (or equal to) text already in
         a vertically-nearby matched box.

    This test stubs the LLM with the exact lines OlmOCR-2 produces on

    that triggers the misalignment — and asserts no two consecutive
