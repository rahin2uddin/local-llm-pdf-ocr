    Asymmetric char-count mismatch cost in [0, 1].

    Over-fill (line longer than the box's area-derived capacity) is
    penalized harder than equivalent under-fill. Rationale: a box's
    expected capacity is proportional to area at typical font size, so
    when a line's character count substantially exceeds that capacity
    the line cannot fit at the same density — it would force the
    embedding to compress horizontally and visually misregister against
    the source layout. Under-fill is benign: a short line in a wide box
    just leaves slack.

    Symptom this fixes: when Surya splits a wrapped paragraph into N
    boxes but the LLM joins it into 1 line, the symmetric cost gave
    near-zero penalty for matching short LLM lines (e.g. ``Date: 9/14/19``)
    to the wrong narrow box just because the char counts happened to
    align, displacing every subsequent line by one box. The empty
    "real" box was then filled by the refine stage, producing a visible
    duplicate in the OCR text layer.

    Formula notes:
    - Overfill uses ``(actual-expected)/actual`` so the cost is bounded
      in [0, 1) and matches the original symmetric-cost shape on the
      overfill side. Mild overfills stay matchable (cheaper than
      ``skip_box + skip_line``); only severe overfills approach 1.
    - Underfill uses ``(expected-actual)/expected * 0.5`` so a short
      line in a wide box costs at most 0.5, and a perfect-width-but-
      short line costs ~0. This breaks symmetry: a 2x overfill costs
      ~0.5 but the same 0.5x under-fill costs only 0.25.
